Idea: application for tracking achievement and competition between people

User script:

user registers

creates new targets (selects from the list of prepared ones)

notes progress on them daily (I don’t smoke for 10 days, I do a press for 17 days, I don’t have sweets for 5 days)

receives badges (any other form of motivation) for achieving or progressing goals

competes with other people for common goals (such as quitting smoking)

receives points for completed achievements (3 goals per month, etc.), account modifiers are available for points (special avatar, etc.)

there must be seasonal events (in honor of the new year 10 push-ups) - confirmation in the form of a photo or video

UI Landing Registration / authorization Dashboard (master page) Page for adding new goals Page for tracking progress for each goal Seasonal event page Page for adding progress for goals Profile page (you can view other people's pages) Achievements page (similar to Heroes.epam.com)
